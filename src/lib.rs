//! Async TLS streams
//!
//! This library is an implementation of TLS streams using the most appropriate
//! system library by default for negotiating the connection. That is, on
//! Windows this library uses SChannel, on OSX it uses SecureTransport, and on
//! other platforms it uses OpenSSL.
//!
//! Each TLS stream implements the `Read` and `Write` traits to interact and
//! interoperate with the rest of the futures I/O ecosystem. Client connections
//! initiated from this crate verify hostnames automatically and by default.
//!
//! This crate primarily exports this ability through two extension traits,
//! `TlsConnectorExt` and `TlsAcceptorExt`. These traits augment the
//! functionality provided by the `native-tls` crate, on which this crate is
//! built. Configuration of TLS parameters is still primarily done through the
//! `native-tls` crate.
